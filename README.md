# Ops-201d8-Code-Challenges
What is this repo all about?
> This repo is filled with code challenges that I've completed during my time at the Code Fellows cyber security camp. These are specifically from the 201 course

Why are you learning these skills?
> Making scripts can automate any future tasks and is alot more efficent than doing it yourself

What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
> 201 was focused around computers and how they work

What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
> I liked the previous one, I think using read to have a user input a dyanmic variable was cool

How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
> Could run the power shell commands to perform updates on remote computers, maybe update firewall rules

What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
> I would like to get a more solid understanding of loops

What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?
> I dont understand flags too much, sometimes they can be straight forward but for the one ( I think its was Ops challenge 9) the flags on that one confused me
